**The notebook description**

Chain of Thought Reasoning

Inner monologue


The system message contains instructions for the Five Steps and additional catalog data.
This allows you to set a fairly complex instruction almost like an algorithm.
It can be useful if we want to cram complex logic into one query.

Question: by how much is the BlueWave Chromebook more expensive than the TechPro Desktop

Answer:
Step 1:#### The user is comparing the prices of two specific products.
Step 2:#### The products being compared are:
- BlueWave Chromebook: Price - $249.99
- TechPro Desktop: Price - $999.99
Step 3:#### The assumption made by the user is that the BlueWave Chromebook is more expensive than the TechPro Desktop.
Step 4:#### The assumption is incorrect. The TechPro Desktop is actually more expensive than the BlueWave Chromebook.
Response to user:#### The TechPro Desktop is actually more expensive than the BlueWave Chromebook. The TechPro Desktop is priced at $999.99, while the BlueWave Chromebook is priced at $249.99

**Notes from lecture**

split complex tasks into a series0:07 of simpler subtasks by chaining multiple0:08 prompts together

This approach breaks down the complexity of the1 task making it easier to manage and reducing the likelihood of errors.

you have a workflow where you can maintain the state of the system at any given point and take different actions depending on
the current state.

This approach can also reduce in lower costs since longer prompts with
more tokens cost more. Another benefit of this approach is that it
is also easier to test which steps might be failing more often or to have a human in the loop
at a specific step.

Instead of describing a whole complex workflow in dozens of bullet points
or several paragraphs in one prompt, it might be better to keep track of the state externally and
then inject relevant instructions as needed.

it also allows the model to use external tools at certain points of the workflow if necessary.

What does "flagged" attribute mean in the response of Moderation API of OpenAI?
In the response from the Moderation API of OpenAI, the "flagged" attribute indicates whether the content being analyzed violates any of the predefined moderation categories.

Here's a breakdown of what it means:

Flagged: true: This indicates that the content has been flagged as potentially violating one or more of the moderation categories, such as hate speech, violence, self-harm, adult content, etc. If flagged is true, it suggests that the content might not be suitable according to OpenAI's guidelines and should be reviewed further or treated with caution.

Flagged: false: This means that the content did not trigger any flags for the moderation categories. The content is considered compliant with OpenAI's guidelines, and there are no immediate concerns based on the categories the API checks.

The Moderation API provides this attribute to help users automatically filter out harmful or inappropriate content and maintain a safer environment in applications.

It picks the product and category mentioned in the customer query from the whole list of products and categories.
It finds relevant product and category names.

It works for pretty complex queries:

Also, what TVs do you have?

some best practices0:37 for evaluating the outputs of an LLM

it'd be quite common to continue to tune your prompt

the workflow of building applications using prompts is very different than a workflow of building 
applications using supervised learning, and the pace of iteration feels much faster.
