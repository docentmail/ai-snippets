# Anthropic API Testing
This folder contains implementation of Anthropic's basic API use cases, and prebuilt computer use AI functionality.\
This README aims to provide easy to follow steps on how to install this and use it yourself, step by step.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.11 or later installed for Phase 1
* Latest version of Docker installed for Phase 2

Start by cloning the repository on your local machine. I will walk you through setting up the Python environment and Docker image to use the services now.

## Phase 1: Basic Anthropic API calls
Let's start by getting our Anthropic API key. Visit [this](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) site to find you API key, and load some credits into your account [here](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing).

### Set up a Python virtual environment:

In the root project directory, create a virtual environment by running the following command:


```bash
python -m venv anthropic_computer_use_api
```

Activate the virtual environment:

* On macOS or Linux:

```bash
source anthropic_computer_use_api/bin/activate
```

* On Windows:
```bash
anthropic_computer_use_api\Scripts\activate
```
> (Important) To exit the virtual environment, run "deactivate" in your terminal.

Install the Anthropic Python package by running:

```bash
pip install anthropic
```

Next, set your API key as a Python environment variable by running

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```
On Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```
### Now, Test the API:

You can test the Anthropic API by running the provided test-01.py script:

```bash
python test-01.py
```

Check your terminal. You will see a response printed! Congratulations, your API call has worked!
