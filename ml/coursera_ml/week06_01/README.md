**Week 06 Part 01**\
[Go to the description of the assignment](_assignment.md)\
[Go to Python notebook for the assignment ](assignment_code/assignment.ipynb)

## Syllabus
Unsupervised learning focuses on identifying patterns in data. This module covers clustering and visualization techniques.

- Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Methods
- **Assignment**: Reducing Image Color Count

## Assignment Overview: 

### FIles and folders
- **[_assignment.md](_assignment.md)**- description of the tasks that need to be solved in the assignment
- **assignment_code**- folder containing solution Python code, dataset and related files
  - **[assignment.ipynb](assignment_code/assignment.ipynb)** - the Pyhon Notebook with solution


### Libraries and Specific Parts Used:
1. **numpy** - Used for numerical computations, imported multiple times.
2. **imread** - Likely used for reading image data.
3. **skimage** - Possibly used for image processing tasks.
4. **KMeans** - Indicates usage of K-Means clustering, a machine learning algorithm.
5. **pprint** - For pretty-printing data structures.
6. **matplotlib** - Used for plotting and visualizing data.
