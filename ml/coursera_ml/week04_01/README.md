[Go to the description of the assignment](_assignment.md)\
[Go to Python notebook for the assignment ](assignment_code/assignment.ipynb)

## Syllabus
This module explores linear models for regression and their connection to singular value decomposition of the object-feature matrix.

- Solving Multidimensional Linear Regression with SVD
- Ridge Regression
- LASSO Method
- **Assignment**: Predicting Salary Based on Job Descriptions

## Assignment Overview: 

### FIles and folders
- **[_assignment.md](_assignment.md)**- description of the tasks that need to be solved in the assignment
- **assignment_code**- folder containing solution Python code, dataset and related files
  - **[assignment.ipynb](assignment_code/assignment.ipynb)** - the Pyhon Notebook with solution



## Libraries and Specific Parts Used:
1. **pandas** - Likely used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **DictVectorizer** - Used for converting feature mappings into a vectorized format.
3. **TfidfVectorizer** - Used for transforming text data into TF-IDF feature representations.
4. **hstack** - Used for stacking arrays horizontally.
5. **Ridge** - Ridge regression algorithm for predictive modeling.
