    "## Orchestrator-Workers Workflow\n",
    "In this workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this workflow\n",
    "This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed. The key difference from simple parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input."
