    "This notebook demonstrates three simple multi-LLM workflows. They trade off cost or latency for potentially improved task performances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt-Chaining**: Decomposes a task into sequential subtasks, where each step builds on previous results\n",
    "2. **Parallelization**: Distributes independent subtasks across multiple LLMs for concurrent processing\n",
    "3. **Routing**: Dynamically selects specialized LLM paths based on input characteristics\n",
