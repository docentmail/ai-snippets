{"Implementation approach":"To create a CLI-based snake game that is engaging, challenging, and runs smoothly, we will use Python due to its simplicity and extensive library support. For handling keyboard input, we'll integrate the 'keyboard' library, which allows us to detect arrow key presses easily. The game logic will be straightforward, focusing on snake movement, collision detection, and score management. We'll aim for a minimalistic UI within the CLI, using standard print statements and clearing the screen to simulate movement. The game's difficulty will increase by either speeding up the snake or introducing more obstacles as the player's score increases.","File list":["main.py","game.py","utils.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        +main() void\n    }\n    class Game {\n        -score int\n        -snake list\n        -food tuple\n        -is_game_over bool\n        +start_game() void\n        +process_input() void\n        +update_game_state() void\n        +render() void\n    }\n    class Utils {\n        +clear_screen() void\n        +generate_food() tuple\n    }\n    Main --> Game\n    Game --> Utils\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant U as Utils\n    M->>G: start_game()\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>G: process_input()\n        G->>G: update_game_state()\n        G->>G: render()\n        G->>U: clear_screen()\n    end\n    Note over G: Game ends when is_game_over is True\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific method of increasing game difficulty and whether additional features like high score tracking are desired."}
