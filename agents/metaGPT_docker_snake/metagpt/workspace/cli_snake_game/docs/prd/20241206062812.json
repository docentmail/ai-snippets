It should offer a simple yet addictive gameplay loop, with clear feedback on player performance. Increasing difficulty and a straightforward way to restart the game after failure are crucial for replayability.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement smooth and responsive snake movement using keyboard input"],["P0","Design a scoring system that rewards players for each piece of food eaten"],["P1","Create a level progression system that increases game speed or complexity"],["P1","Develop a simple, intuitive UI for the CLI environment"],["P2","Add a feature to allow players to restart the game quickly after losing"]],"UI Design draft":"The game will feature a simple, text-based interface. The snake can be represented by a series of characters, and the food by a different symbol. The score will be displayed at the top or bottom of the screen. Game over and restart options will be clearly indicated.","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
